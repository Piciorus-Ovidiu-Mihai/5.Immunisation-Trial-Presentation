# Immunisation-Trial-Presentation
I made this application in the program of .NET full-stack at Arobs with other four students. During this program I learned how to work in a team and on a real project.

## What I used ?
For this application we used an API for connecting the client with the database. For the client we used ASP.NET MVC Core and we made a library for all the models.

## What I learned ?
I learned about ASP.NET MVC Core and API . For database we used code first with entity framework and we integrated many features such sending emails.I learned how to work in a team , how to share our tasks , how to think about a big project , how to use git and how to make a scalable application.
